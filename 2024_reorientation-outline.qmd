#### There is a lot of information here, and we don't have a lot of time. So some of this we'll just touch on in order to leave space for your questions.

* Although ChatGPT seemed to explode into the public consciousness, it is part of a surprisingly long history of technological development.
* Understanding at least some of that history can help us understand the affordances and limitations of LLMs. They kind of seem like magic, but they're not. 
* ChatGPT and other LLMs are also part of the inextricable relationship between writing and technology, which doesn't mean that they don't present their own problems and challenges.
* Research is showing that the writing produced by LLMs don't much look like human writing in a number of important ways.
